# The Typescript & React Task Maker

So here we are. The first React/Typescript personal project. In true learning fashion I've had another go at making a todo list to apply the typescript skills.

It is a CRUD application. So you can create, read, update and delete todos. The main focus is on getting my hands on Typescript. However, this didn't stop me learning some cool react skills at the same time.

The input bar is autofocused, so you can instantly write another todo upon submission. 

The icons are imported from the react icon library. This is the first time I've used it.

If you click the 'tick' icon, it will conditionally render a filled equivalent and put a line through the text.
